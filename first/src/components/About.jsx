    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Shubham Singh, a hands-on technologist and problem solver with a sharp eye for detail
      and a deep-rooted passion for elegant code and impactful solutions. Currently pursuing a
      Master’s in Applied Computer Science at OsloMet, I bring a solid foundation in both
      engineering principles and real-world software development.
    </p>
    <p>
      With over a decade of experience spanning tutoring, technical consulting, and AI/ML projects,
      I specialize in transforming ideas into working systems fast. Whether I’m building smart
      feature toggles in Wix with Sanity CMS and Postman, or diving deep into CNNs and BERT models
      for emotional and sentiment analysis, I take pride in writing code that’s not just functional,
      but purposeful.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thrive in environments that demand both analytical rigor and creative intuition. I'm
      continuously exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source, and mentoring students
      in mathematics and machine learning. Let’s build something meaningful.
