    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Shubham Singh, a hands-on technologist, AI engineer, and digital problem-solver with over a decade of experience in tutoring,
      consulting, and full-stack development. Currently pursuing my Master's in Applied Computer Science at OsloMet, I bridge deep theoretical
      understanding with real-world technical execution.

      Whether it's deploying CI/CD pipelines in Docker and GitLab, 
      fine-tuning BERT models for sentiment analysis, or creating immersive 3D renderings with NeRF and PyTorch3D, 
      I specialize in turning complexity into clarity. My work combines thoughtful design with scalable code, because I believe great software is both functional and beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm passionate about building systems that matter. From designing resilient infrastructures for creative 
      agencies to mentoring students in machine learning, I thrive at the intersection of innovation, precision, and human impact. 
      Let's build something bold and build it right.
